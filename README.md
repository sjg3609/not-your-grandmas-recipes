# Not Your Grandma's Recipes Box

## Description

_Duration: 3 Weeks

Not Your Grandmas Recipe Box solves an issue of having a family recipe box full of recipe cards, and not having a way to instantly find and access them! With Not Your Grandmas allows the user to see all recipes in the application, add a new one, and then be able to leave notes on individual recipes after they make them! You can also edit recipes after posting them to the application to correct any errors, or make changes to the name, ingredients and instructions.

## Installation

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
